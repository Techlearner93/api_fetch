## This simple react app's objective is to learn how to fetch data from an API, learn the basic concepts of async, await, promises and mapping the response out into a visual UI.

## After I mapped out the response data from the API, I realise that it is a good time to learn how to include a simple search feature; which I learnt that the simplest way is to just filter the data array, before mapping it.
